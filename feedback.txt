I‚Äôm going to introduce, explain[,] and discuss a method to solve the Rubiks Cube called
Roux. I will assume the reader [does] not know how to solve the Rubiks Cube[.] [H]owever the
geometric understanding of the cube is usefu[l]. Thus I will also mention some very basic
information which might seem redundant to others.

First off, I am going to cover the Beginner‚Äôs
Method, also known as Layer by Layer Method[.]
[The method] does what the name implies: it solves the
cube layer by layer. This method seems pretty
intuitive to most people as it starts off by solv-
ing one Face (which is easy to begin with). 
[Absatz]
The
most common method is closely related to the Be-
ginner‚Äôs Method: Fridrich‚Äôs Method or more com-
monly known as CFOP. CFOP [starts off ‚Üí begins] by form-
ing a cross on one side, extending that cross to the
f irst two layers, orienting[,] and permutating the last
layer (leading to its unique name). You can see how
closely related it is to the Beginner‚Äôs Method: The
key difference [being‚Üíis] that the Beginner‚Äôs Method
splits building the first two layers into two seperate steps whereas CFOP does this more
efficiently. There are [quite‚ÜíŒµ] some more methods which deserve to be named here, for
instance Petrus‚Äô Method, but I‚Äôm going to leave it at that.

Ne das Face mitten im Satz

Philip Wellnitz, [06.01.16 00:41]
For clarification: we consider [a the ‚Üí a oder the] respective side of the cube to face us as we turn it[.]
[F]or instance U and D rotate opposite sides and turn in opposite directions. We certainly
could also use U3 with the same logic as we defined U2 yet we would notice that U3 is
the very same as U‚Äô. We also see that R2 and R2‚Äô result in the same turns[,] [S]o would
[someone] want to use R2‚Äô at all? Yes - sometimes it can be useful to hint using two R‚Äô
moves over two R moves [for more comfortable turning (klingt komisch)]. Note how we are using uppercase
letters for the basic turns. Lowercase letters are reserved for an upcoming notation.

Philip Wellnitz, [06.01.16 00:44]
Sometimes the basic turns are inconvenient to use in
a certain case, for instance if you wanted to turn the
middle slice[, i.e.,] the slice [which is‚ÜíŒµ] sandwiched between the
right and the left side.
For that reason we define the middle slice turn, the
equatorial slice turn and the standing slice turn. We
again abbreviate them respectively with their initials.
However we need to declare that M turns in the same
direction as L, E turns in the same direction as D[,] and
S turns in the same direction as F. Intuitively, we can
append the earlier defined suffixes ‚Äô and 2 with their
corresponding interpretations.

Philip Wellnitz, [06.01.16 00:47]
For [a] similar motivation as why we introduce[d] the slice
turns, we also define wide moves. Wide moves are
pretty self-explanatory: you grab two layers by expand-
ing a face turn by the adjacent slice. We respectively add w for wide to our collection
of suffixes. As we add more suffixes, we want to introduce an abbreviated form for wide
moves: replacing the uppercase letter by a lowercase one.
The last notation we want to introduce are cube rotations. Cube rotations require you
to turn the entire cube inside your hands. We denote them as the three axes x, y and
z. Again we need to clarify which axis turns in which direction: x turns in the same
direction as R, y turns in the same direction as U and z turns in the same direction as F.
Since you might run into this question: we do not differentiate between uppercase and
lowercase cube rotations.

Du switched von I und We hin und her, das k√∂nntest du vereinheitlichen

Philip Wellnitz, [06.01.16 00:53]
Before we go into detail, I am going to give you a rough idea of how [R]oux works.   //Evtl ‚Üí Abstract?
You start of by what [is] called the [f]irst [b]lock[Œµüòè you build a
1x2x3 block of one color around the matching center. Next
[up‚ÜíŒµ], we will mirror the first block onto the opposite side.
This leaves us in the state of the [f]irst [t]wo [b]locks already
solved. If we were looking from the front side, we would
see that we are left with a T-shaped area which is yet to be
solved. Notice how every piece that is yet to be solved is on
either the middle slice or the upper layer. Mathematicians
like to call these pieces the (linear) span, denoted as hM, U i, //Tex‚ÜíASCII ist kaputt
of the turns U and M.
We now want to solve the corners of the upper layer to
be left with six unsolved edges and four unsolved centers.
Solving the corners of the upper layer will be split into two
seperate steps[.] [F]irst[,] we orient the corners to have their common color face up[.] [T]hen[,]
we permute them to the places where they belong. Both of these steps are not very
trivial and thus will require some algorithms. If you want to figure out some algorithms
yourself, you usually want to try to break up the [f]irst [t]wo [b]locks and then reconstruct
them slightly differently. But there is no big learning effect involved[,] so I would not
recommend doing so.

Philip Wellnitz, [06.01.16 00:56]
As mentioned previously, we are now left with six edges
and four centers unsolved. As you realize quickly, the cen-
ters are at most two M-slice moves from being in their correct
positions, leaving us with the [l]ast [s]ix [e]dges unsolved. You
can see in the figure beside how the cube would look so far.
What speeds up the process of solving the [l]ast [s]ix [e]dges
is the fact that you can now solve the cube by only using
algorithms of hM, U i, [i.e.], you do not have to scramble
what you have solved so far.
[Absatz]
 No we would like to split solv-
ing the [l]ast [s]ix [e]dges into three substeps: orienting the
edges, solving the left and right upper edge[,] and finishing
the middle slice.

Philip Wellnitz, [06.01.16 00:57]
By [saying‚ÜíŒµ] orienting the edges we mean that we want them
to only show bottom or top layer stickers on the bottom and top layer. In our example,
this would make the U-face only contain blue and green stickers. This can either be
achieved intuitively with a little bit of practise or by folloing the patterns and steps
mentioned in the according section below. Now we intuitively insert the last remaining
edges on the left- and right-hand side. All that is left to do is resolving one out of four
cases to finish off the middle layer.

Soweit ich zu dieser Uhrzeit voll alle auf mich einstr√∂menden Eindr√ºcke wahrnehmen kann sollte ich alle Fehler (meiner Ansicht nach) gefunden haben
Ansonsten wirkt das schon voll gut
